# traffic-ha-rss
Android Road Traffic application which pulls down data from the Highways Agency  RSS feed and displays it as a RecyclerView based list.

- Navigation drawer.
- Recycler View list.
- Severity icons
- Multi text rows.
- Cardview based details view.
- Background loader.
- Actionbar support libraries.
- Settings View.
- Map view.
- Filterable category types.
- Content provider persistence.
- Android Studio based project.

This uses a number of my own libraries

- Base RSS pull parser (nice and fast).

- Easy CP - Makes creating a Content Provider a breeze. This has been embedded as a module into the project.
